# 0x08. Palindrome integer

## Task

Write a function that checks whether or not a given unsigned integer is a palindrome.

+ Prototype: `int is_palindrome(unsigned long n);`
+ Where `n` is the number to be checked
+ Your function must return `1` if `n` is a palindrome, and `0` otherwise
+ You are not **allowed** to allocate memory dynamically (malloc, calloc, …)

## Requirements

+ Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
+ All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS`
+ Your programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic`
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
+ You are not allowed to use global variables
+ No more than 5 functions per file
+ The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `palindrome.h`
+ Don’t forget to push your header file
+ All your header files should be include guarded
