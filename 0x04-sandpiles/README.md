# 0x04. Sandpiles

Write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles

+ Prototype: `void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3]);`
+ You can assume that both `grid1` and `grid2` are individually stable
+ A `sandpile` is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains
+ When your function is done, grid1 must be stable
+ `grid1` must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable (See example)
+ Youâ€™re not allowed to allocate memory dynamically

## Requirements

+ Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
+ All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS`
+ Your programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic`
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
+ You are not allowed to use global variables
+ No more than 5 functions per file
