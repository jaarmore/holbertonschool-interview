# 0x0E. Linear search in skip list

## Requirements

+ Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs` 
+ All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS`
+ Your programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra` and `-pedantic`
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
+ You are not allowed to use global variables
+ No more than 5 functions per file
+ The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `search.h`
+ Don’t forget to push your header file
+ All your header files should be include guarded

### More Info

#### `search.h` file

Please define the following data structure in your `search.h` header file:

```
#ifndef _SEARCH_H_
#define _SEARCH_H_

#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdint.h>


/**
 * struct skiplist_s - Singly linked list with an express lane
 *
 * @n: Integer
 * @index: Index of the node in the list
 * @next: Pointer to the next node
 * @express: Pointer to the next node in the express lane
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure with an express lane
 * for Holberton project
 */
typedef struct skiplist_s
{
    int n;
    size_t index;
    struct skiplist_s *next;
    struct skiplist_s *express;
} skiplist_t;

skiplist_t *create_skiplist(int *array, size_t size);
void print_skiplist(const skiplist_t *list);
void free_skiplist(skiplist_t *list);
skiplist_t *linear_skip(skiplist_t *head, int value);

#endif /* _SEARCH_H_ */
```

### Tasks

1. Linear search in a skip list

Looking for a specific value in a singly linked list always leads to browse every element of the list. A common way to optimize the time complexity of a search in a singly linked list is to modify the list itself by adding an “express lane” to browse it. A linked list with an express lane is called a skip list.
